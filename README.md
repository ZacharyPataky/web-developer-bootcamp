# web-developer-bootcamp

This repository contains the code written during my time studying Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022] on Udemy.

This course was completely overhauled in 2022 to illuminate the most important topics for modern web development.  Without a doubt, it's the most comprehensive and effective web development course on the market.  Here's why:

* This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.
* 94% of Colt's in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them were complete beginners when they started the program.
* Everything covered is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market, requiring eight months of hard labor redoing it for the new year.
* This course contains over thirteen projects, including a capstone project called YelpCamp.
* The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.

Completing this course taught me many things.  You can find most of them in the repo by analyzing the directory names.  However, for a complete run-down, let me tell you what I learned:

* The ins and outs of HTML5, CSS3, and Modern JavaScript for 2021
* Make REAL web applications using cutting-edge technologies
* Create responsive, accessible, and beautiful layouts
* Recognize and prevent common security exploits like SQL-Injection & XSS
